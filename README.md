# BMI Calculator (Beginner Python Project)

A simple command-line **Body Mass Index (BMI)** calculator written in Python.

Calculates your BMI using height (in inches) and weight (in pounds) and tells you your weight category with a bit of personality.

## Features
- Asks for your name, age, height, and weight
- Calculates BMI using the imperial formula:  
  `BMI = (weight × 703) / (height²)`
- Shows your weight status:
  - Underweight (< 18.5)
  - Normal weight (18.5–24.9)
  - Overweight (25–29.9)
  - Obese (30+)
- Contains friendly (and slightly savage) encouragement messages

## How to Run

1. Make sure you have **Python 3** installed
2. Copy the code into a file called `bmi_calculator.py`
3. Run it:

```bash
python bmi_calculator.py
